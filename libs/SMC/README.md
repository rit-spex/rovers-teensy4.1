- Note either SCL pins will work on the `G2 24v19` of boards
- The SDA and SCL pins do not have pull-up resistors enabled, so you should make sure that your
master device has pull-ups on both lines, or add external ones yourself. If you find that you need to
add **<u>pull-up resistors</u>, a resistance of 10 kÎ©** is a good place to start, but you might need to adjust the
resistance depending on how much capacitance is on the bus and how fast you want to run the clock
